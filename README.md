# Unicode

Not all characters  appear exactly as the galactic standard alphabet. After observing many languages, the characters that looked the closest to the original were chosen.

Attempts were made to avoid tofu in the character selection. Your operating system must have a font that supports displaying the unicode characters returned. That font must be used in the location you are viewing (terminal, code editor, web page) the results.

See [candidates](./unicode.md) that can be substituted.
